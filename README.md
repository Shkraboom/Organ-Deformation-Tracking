# Organ-Deformation-Tracking
Implementation of the method of dynamic binding and deformation of a 3D model of an organ from an endoscope video stream for surgical navigation tasks
## Problem
During endoscopic operations, it is necessary to ensure an accurate and
stable binding of the 3D model of the organ to the image of the organ on the video stream
coming from the endoscope. This is critically important for surgical navigation tasks,
especially considering:
- the movement of the camera (endoscope) itself
- mobility and deformity of the organ
- interactions with surgical instruments (contact, pressure, displacement
of tissues)
